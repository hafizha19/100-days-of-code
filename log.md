### Day 1: May 24, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Make Calculator-Web design with CSS
**Thoughts**: Asik, yaiya masih CSS wkwk. It is a new thing for me and I have slowly progress about it, but I enjoyed it.

### Day 2: May 25, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Complete Calculator-Web function with JS
**Thoughts**: Mulai menguras energi. It is harder than PHP, oh maybe it happened because JS is new for me :) Ganbatte!!
